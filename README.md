# Fractal Kanban Board Demo

A React-based kanban prototype for infinite nesting of boards, focusing on hierarchical task visualization and space-efficient interactions. NOT actually functional (can't create/delete/edit tasks, drag tasks, persist data, etc). I just wanted to see what it would feel like, if getting the CSS right was even possible, and hope someone actually implements it. See thread for demo + thoughts:

- Expandable/collapsible card previews
- Horizontal/vertical layout switching
- Hover-based board previews
- Depth-based visual hierarchy
- Smooth animations and transitions
